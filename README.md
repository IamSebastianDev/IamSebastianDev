# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I am Sebastian, a fullstack developer from Munich, Germany. Nice of you to swing by! I mostly do frontend development, but my guilty pleasure is creating my own packages & libraries and sharing them with the open-source community. ðŸ“¦ I also teach people basics in webdevelopment.
